# 9router — AI Agent Guide

> **Universal API proxy**: One OpenAI-compatible endpoint → 100+ AI providers (LLM, image, TTS, STT, embedding, search). Next.js 16 + standalone output + PM2.

## Behavioral Rules (MANDATORY)

These rules override all other instructions. Every AI agent working on this codebase MUST follow them:

1. **No assumptions without evidence.** Never claim something is "fixed", "working", or "correct" unless you have concrete proof — test output, diff comparison, or reproducible verification. "It should work" is not evidence.

2. **Be skeptical of your own results.** If a test passes, verify it tests what you think it tests. If a fix appears to work, check for side effects. If you're about to report success, ask yourself: "Could I be wrong? What would prove me wrong?"

3. **Never fabricate reports.** Do not claim "all tests pass" without running them. Do not claim "no regressions" without comparing before/after. Do not suppress or hide failures to make a fix look complete.

4. **Distinguish "pre-existing" from "caused by my changes" with proof.** Run the same tests on the code BEFORE your changes and AFTER, then diff the results. Do not label failures as "pre-existing" based on assumptions about what your code touches.

5. **Report honestly.** If something is broken and you can't fix it, say so. If a test is skipped, explain why. If a fix has caveats, state them. Never suppress issues to present a clean picture.

6. **Verify before declaring done.** Run the relevant tests AFTER your changes. Show the actual output. If tests fail, investigate before moving on.

7. **Docker DB volume is persistent state.** Never rename `9router-data` in `docker-compose.yml`. A Compose volume-name change creates a new empty `/app/data` volume without an application error, making SQLite data appear lost. Intentional rename requires explicit volume-copy migration and verification of `/app/data/db/data.sqlite` before deleting the old volume.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
PORT=3003 node scripts/deploy-atomic.cjs
# Run only after health/version verification; never during an experiment.
pm2 save
```

`ecosystem.config.cjs` pins PM2 to the persistent `server.js` launcher. The launcher follows `RELEASE_SERVER` through `/var/lib/9router/current`; PM2 must never point directly at a release inside `/tmp`.

Atomic deployment builds an isolated release, validates its static chunks, switches `/var/lib/9router/current` only after smoke checks, and retains the previous release for rollback:

```bash
node scripts/deploy-atomic.cjs rollback
```

Full deployment details: see [`agent.md`](./agent.md)

## Architecture

```
Client (OpenAI format) → /api/v1/* → SSE handlers → Translator → Executor → Provider
                                                                    ↓
                              Response ← Translator (provider → client format)
```

### Request Flow (Chat)
1. `src/sse/handlers/chat.js` — auth, model resolution, retry loop
2. `open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js` — translate, inject RTK/Caveman/Ponytail, execute
3. `open-sse/translator/` — format conversion (OpenAI ↔ Claude/Gemini/Kiro/etc)
4. `open-sse/executors/` — per-provider HTTP calls

## Key Conventions

1. **Config-driven**: All constants in `open-sse/config/` and `src/shared/constants/`. Never hardcode.
2. **DRY**: Reuse `translator/schema/`, `translator/concerns/`, `translator/formats/`.
3. **Provider registry**: Add to `open-sse/providers/registry/{id}.js`, regenerate index.
4. **Translator pairs**: Register `request/<from>-to-<to>.js` + `response/<from>-to-<to>.js`.
5. **ESM**: All imports use `.js` extension.

## Adding Features

| Task | Where | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| New provider | `open-sse/providers/registry/{id}.js` | Copy REGISTRY_TEMPLATE, add models to `providerModels.js` |
| Custom executor | `open-sse/executors/{name}.js` | Subclass BaseExecutor, register in `index.js` |
| New translator | `open-sse/translator/request\|response/` | Call `register(from, to, fn)`, import in `translator/index.js` |
| Token saver | `open-sse/rtk/{name}.js` | Import in chatCore.js, add to handleChatCore params |
| API endpoint | `src/app/api/{path}/route.js` | Next.js App Router |
| Dashboard UI | `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/{page}/` | Client components |

## Custom Features (9router-specific)

- **ACL per API key**: `allowedProviders`, `allowedCombos`, `allowedKinds` in key settings
- **Token Saver**: RTK (compress tool output) + Caveman (terse output) + Ponytail (YAGNI code)
- **Combo strategies**: Fallback, Round Robin, Fusion (parallel + judge), Capacity auto-switch
- **Provider nodes**: Custom OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible providers with UUID suffix

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test                    # All tests
pnpm test tests/unit/        # Unit tests only
pnpm test tests/translator/  # Translator tests
```

## Release CI/CD

Release/tag/deploy rules are mandatory: read [`.agent/cicd.md`](./.agent/cicd.md) before changing release files, bumping versions, updating `CHANGELOG.md`, creating tags, or deploying production.

## Important Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/shared/constants/providers.js` | Provider definitions, aliases, ACL list |
| `src/shared/constants/models.js` | Model definitions per provider |
| `open-sse/config/providers.js` | Provider registry build |
| `open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js` | Core chat handler (RTK/Caveman/Ponytail injection) |
| `src/sse/services/auth.js` | API key validation, ACL checks |
| `src/sse/services/allowedModels.js` | Model access control |

## Troubleshooting

- **502 Bad Gateway**: Check `PORT` env matches Nginx upstream (`pm2 env 9router | grep PORT`)
- **Missing CSS/icons or chunks**: Do not copy assets into a live release; rerun `node scripts/deploy-atomic.cjs` so the complete artifact is activated together.
- **Provider 401/403**: Check token refresh logic in `open-sse/services/tokenRefresh/`
- **Translator errors**: Check format detection in `open-sse/services/provider.js`
